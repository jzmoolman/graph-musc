Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. Recruits DNA helicase MCM9 to chromatin which unwinds the mismatch containing DNA strand (PubMed:26300262). ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH) is a condition that primarily affects the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are glands on top of the kidneys that produce hormones regulating many essential functions in the body. PBMAH is a condition that can cause lumps (nodules) to form in the adrenal glands leading them to enlarge and produce too much of a certain hormone (cortisol). Increased cortisol can result in weight gain, high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes, fatigue and bone loss. When symptoms of PBMAH are present, they usually begin in middle age. However, some with PBMAH may not have any obvious symptoms (incomplete penetrance). Specific laboratory tests and imaging are typically used to diagnose PBMAH. A dexamethasone suppression test measures the response of the adrenal glands to the hormone ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone); affected individuals often have elevated cortisol levels in blood and urine as well as low levels of ACTH in blood following this test. Imaging often shows large, nodular adrenal glands. Treatment for severe cases may include the surgical removal of one or both adrenal glands.

WT1-related disorders are associated with an increased risk for Wilms tumor, a type of renal cancer, which typically presents in early childhood. WT1-related Wilms tumor may occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome. Deletions of WT1 along with the neighboring PAX6 gene are associated with WAGR (Wilms tumor-aniridia-genital anomalies-retardation) syndrome, characterized by Wilms tumor, genitourinary anomalies, intellectual disability, and aniridia (PMID: 22692063).  Other WT1-related disorders include Denys-Drash syndrome, which has a high risk of Wilms tumor and genitourinary anomalies, and Frasier syndrome, which is more often associated with gonadoblastoma and less often with Wilms tumor (PMID: 23295293, 9529364).

The panel recommends that such screening only take place after an in-depth discussion about the potential limitations to screening, including cost, the high incidence of pancreatic abnormalities, and uncertainties about the potential benefits of pancreatic cancer screening. Consider screening using annual contrast-enhanced MRI/MRCP and/or EUS, with consideration of shorter screening intervals, based on clinical judgment, for individuals found to have worrisome abnormalities on screening.

Mutations carriers have an increased risk of prostate cancer before age 65 years, and prostate cancer in men with germline BRCA2 or HOXB13 mutations occurs earlier and is more likely to be associated with prostate cancer mortality. For men with BRCA1, ATM, or mismatch repair (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) germline gene mutations timing of testing is less clear. Consequently, prostate cancer screening is recommended at age 40 years for BRCA2 carriers, and it is reasonable for men with other germline mutations to consider beginning shared decision-making about PSA screening at age 40 years and to consider screening at annual intervals rather than every other year. In addition, the panel believes that men with a family history of prostate cancer (defined as brother or father or multiple family members who were diagnosed with prostate cancer [but not clinically localized Grade Group 1] at <60 years of age or who died from prostate cancer) should begin shared decision-making about PSA screening at the age corresponding to 10 years prior to the age of the youngest family diagnosis. Men of African American ancestry have a higher incidence of prostate cancer, increased prostate cancer mortality, and earlier age of diagnosis compared to Caucasian men. This is attributable to a greater risk of developing preclinical prostate cancer and a higher likelihood that a preclinical tumor will spread. Many support the recommendation for men of African ancestry to consider beginning shared decision-making about PSA screening at age 40 years and to consider screening at annual intervals rather than every other year. There is no current evidence to support that screening at an earlier age will result in decreased morbidity and mortality compared to testing at age 45.Testing after 75 years of age should be done only in very healthy men with little or no comorbidity (especially if they have never undergone PSA testing or have a rising PSA) to detect the small number of aggressive cancers that pose a significant risk if left undetected until signs or symptoms develop. Widespread testing in this population would substantially increase rates of over detection and is not recommended."})

However, one notable exception is the multi-focality of pancreaticoduodenal NETs in patients with MEN1. The role of surgery remains controversial in patients with multifocal tumors.

If surgery is performed to resect hormonally functional tumor(s), attempts should be made to preoperatively localize the site of the functional tumor. Surgical resection can be considered in the following scenarios: symptomatic functional tumors refractory to medical management, tumor larger than 2 cm in size, Tumor with relatively rapid rate of growth over 6-12 months. Endoscopy with EUS is recommended prior to pancreatic surgery in order to preoperatively assess the localized tumors.

The evaluation of these symptoms should include endometrial biopsy. Endometrial cancer screening does not have proven benefit in women with CS/PHTS. However, endometrial biopsy is both highly sensitive and highly specific as a diagnostic procedure. Screening via endometrial biopsy every 1 to 2 years can be considered. Transvaginal ultrasound to screen for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal individuals has not been shown to be sufficiently sensitive or specific as to support a positive recommendation, but may be considered at the clinician's discretion.

When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. Recruits DNA helicase MCM9 to chromatin which unwinds the mismatch containing DNA strand (PubMed:26300262). ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.
