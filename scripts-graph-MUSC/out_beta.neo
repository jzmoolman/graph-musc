Autosomal dominant acrodysostosis is characterized by variable skeletal, endocrine, and neurological abnormalities that are present in childhood (PMID: 22464252). The most common features include brachydactyly, dysmorphic facies, short stature, and intellectual disability and/or developmental delays (PMID: 26763073). Other symptoms may include advanced bone age, peripheral dysostosis with shortened bones of the hands and feet, cone-shaped epiphyses, lumbar stenosis, hypothyroidism, multiple hormone resistance, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, deafness and rhinitis (PMID: 22464252, 23033274, 26763073).

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. Recruits DNA helicase MCM9 to chromatin which unwinds the mismatch containing DNA strand (PubMed:26300262). ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis"})

Mutations carriers have an increased risk of prostate cancer before age 65 years, and prostate cancer in men with germline BRCA2 or HOXB13 mutations occurs earlier and is more likely to be associated with prostate cancer mortality. For men with BRCA1, ATM, or mismatch repair (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) germline gene mutations timing of testing is less clear. Consequently, prostate cancer screening is recommended at age 40 years for BRCA2 carriers, and it is reasonable for men with other germline mutations to consider beginning shared decision-making about PSA screening at age 40 years and to consider screening at annual intervals rather than every other year. In addition, the panel believes that men with a family history of prostate cancer (defined as brother or father or multiple family members who were diagnosed with prostate cancer [but not clinically localized Grade Group 1] at <60 years of age or who died from prostate cancer) should begin shared decision-making about PSA screening at the age corresponding to 10 years prior to the age of the youngest family diagnosis. Men of African American ancestry have a higher incidence of prostate cancer, increased prostate cancer mortality, and earlier age of diagnosis compared to Caucasian men. This is attributable to a greater risk of developing preclinical prostate cancer and a higher likelihood that a preclinical tumor will spread. Many support the recommendation for men of African ancestry to consider beginning shared decision-making about PSA screening at age 40 years and to consider screening at annual intervals rather than every other year.

Because ovarian cancer onset in patients with BRCA2 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants is an average of 8-10 years later than in patients with BRCA1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, it is reasonable to delay RRSO for management of ovarian cancer risk until age 40-45 years in patients with BRCA2 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants unless age at diagnosis in the family warrants earlier age for consideration of prophylactic surgery. Counseling includes a discussion of reproductive desires, extent of cancer risk, degree of protection for breast and ovarian cancer, management of menopausal symptoms, hormone replacement therapy, and related medical issues. Address psychosocial and quality-of-life aspects of undergoing risk-reducing mastectomy and/or Salpingo-oophorectomy. Salpingectomy alone is not the standard of care for risk reduction, although clinical trials of interval salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy are ongoing. The concern for risk-reducing salpingectomy alone is that women are still at risk for developing ovarian cancer. In addition, in premenopausal women, oophorectomy likely reduces the risk of developing breast cancer but the magnitude is uncertain and may be gene-specific.

PBMAH is a condition that can cause lumps (nodules) to form in the adrenal glands leading them to enlarge and produce too much of a certain hormone (cortisol). Increased cortisol can result in weight gain, high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes, fatigue and bone loss. When symptoms of PBMAH are present, they usually begin in middle age. However, some with PBMAH may not have any obvious symptoms (incomplete penetrance). Specific laboratory tests and imaging are typically used to diagnose PBMAH. A dexamethasone suppression test measures the response of the adrenal glands to the hormone ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone); affected individuals often have elevated cortisol levels in blood and urine as well as low levels of ACTH in blood following this test. Imaging often shows large, nodular adrenal glands. Treatment for severe cases may include the surgical removal of one or both adrenal glands. Otherwise treatment is supportive and focused on managing the individual's symptoms.", Pmids: "Unknown", Gene_Name: "ARMC5", References: "Unknown"})

Pathogenic loss-of-function (LOF) variants cause FHH, characterized by hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria, although most affected individuals are asymptomatic (PMID: 31189130). Individuals with FIHP often present with one or more hyperplastic parathyroid glands, resulting in elevated parathyroid hormone and hypercalemia; like FHH, most individuals are asymptomatic due to early diagnosis and treatment (PMID: 31189130). NSHPT presents in infancy with parathyroid hyperplasia, elevated parathyroid hormone levels and hypercalcemia, which can result in bone demineralization and failure to thrive.

Encourage patient education and prompt response to symptoms (e.g., abnormal bleeding). Patients are encouraged to keep a calendar in order to identify irregularities in their menstrual cycle. Because endometrial cancer can often be detected early based on symptoms, women should be educated regarding the importance of prompt reporting and evaluation of any abnormal uterine bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding. The evaluation of these symptoms should include endometrial biopsy. Endometrial cancer screening does not have proven benefit in women with CS/PHTS. However, endometrial biopsy is both highly sensitive and highly specific as a diagnostic procedure. Screening via endometrial biopsy every 1 to 2 years can be considered. Transvaginal ultrasound to screen for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal individuals has not been shown to be sufficiently sensitive or specific as to support a positive recommendation, but may be considered at the clinician's discretion. Transvaginal ultrasound is not recommended as a screening tool in premenopausal individuals due to the wide range of endometrial stripe thickness throughout the normal menstrual cycle."})

For individuals considering pancreatic cancer screening, the panel recommends that screening be performed in experienced high-volume centers, ideally under research conditions. The panel recommends that such screening only take place after an in-depth discussion about the potential limitations to screening, including cost, the high incidence of pancreatic abnormalities, and uncertainties about the potential benefits of pancreatic cancer screening.

Consider screening using annual contrast-enhanced MRI/MRCP and/or EUS, with consideration of shorter screening intervals, based on clinical judgment, for individuals found to have worrisome abnormalities on screening.

Many support the recommendation for men of African ancestry to consider beginning shared decision-making about PSA screening at age 40 years and to consider screening at annual intervals rather than every other year.

NF1 is a neurocutaneous disorder associated with an increased risk of several types of benign and malignant tumors. Primary features include multiple cafe-au-lait spots, inguinal freckling and neurofibromas. NF1 is highly variable in its expression, even among affected members of the same family. There is an increased risk for tumors of the central nervous system neoplasms and other malignancies including female breast cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, pheochromocytoma and soft tissue sarcomas (PMID: 20301288). Approximately one-half of NF1 cases are inherited, and the remainder are the result of de novo mutations (PMID: 20082463).             Allelic NF1 disorders include Watson syndrome and NFNS. Watson syndrome is characterized by pulmonic stenosis, cafe-au-lait spots, macrocephaly, Lisch nodules, intellectual disability and short stature (PMID: 1770531, 23047742).

CNC is characterized by myxomas, endocrine tumors and schwannomas. Pigmentary skin lesions are a defining feature, present in over 80% of cases. Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), which can lead to Cushing's syndrome, develops in 25-60% of affected individuals. CNC is associated with an increased risk of developing thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer, myxomas in the heart, breast, skin, throat and female genital tract in addition to psammomatous melanotic schwannomas (PMS) and ovarian tumors. Large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors (LCCSCTs) are observed in nearly all affected males (PMID: 26130139, 16756677).

Autosomal dominant acrodysostosis is characterized by variable skeletal, endocrine, and neurological abnormalities that are present in childhood (PMID: 22464252). The most common features include brachydactyly, dysmorphic facies, short stature, and intellectual disability and/or developmental delays (PMID: 26763073). Other symptoms may include advanced bone age, peripheral dysostosis with shortened bones of the hands and feet, cone-shaped epiphyses, lumbar stenosis, hypothyroidism, multiple hormone resistance, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, deafness and rhinitis (PMID: 22464252, 23033274, 26763073).

Pathogenic loss-of-function (LOF) variants in KIT are associated with piebaldism, a rare condition characterized by patchy absence of melanocytes in the skin and hair. These unpigmented areas are typically present at birth and do not increase in size or number (PMID: 19555431, 7529964, 7525736).

Pathogenic gain-of-function (GOF) KIT variants are associated with familial GIST and familial mastocytosis. Familial GIST is a primarily adult-onset condition characterized by sarcomas of the stomach and small bowel that may be benign or malignant (PMID: 23648119, 26833487, 9438854). Familial mastocytosis causes abnormal accumulation of mast cells in the skin and bone marrow (PMID: 27777718, 28031180). In childhood, this condition is known as cutaneous mastocytosis because it manifests in the skin, often resolving by puberty. Adult-onset cases are known as systemic mastocytosis due to involvement of the bone marrow and skin, with potential risks for hematologic malignancy (PMID: 27777718, 28031180). Some individuals with pathogenic GOF KIT variants may present with features of both GIST and mastocytosis (PMID: 27777718).

This gene was initially identified as a homolog of the feline sarcoma viral oncogene v-kit and is often referred to as proto-oncogene c-Kit. The canonical form of this glycosylated transmembrane protein has an N-terminal extracellular region with five immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain at the C-terminus. Upon activation by its cytokine ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), this protein phosphorylates multiple intracellular proteins that play a role in in the proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis of many cell types and thereby plays an important role in hematopoiesis, stem cell maintenance, gametogenesis, melanogenesis, and in mast cell development, migration and function. This protein can be a membrane-bound or soluble protein. Mutations in this gene are associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors, mast cell disease, acute myelogenous leukemia, and piebaldism. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]"})

MSH2-related Lynch syndrome is characterized by an increased risk of colorectal cancer as well as cancers of the endometrium, ovary, stomach, biliary tract, bladder, urinary tract, prostate, brain and possibly small intestines. Estimated lifetime risks include a 33–52% risk for colorectal cancer, up to a 9% risk for gastric cancer, up to a 1.7% risk for cancer of the biliary tract, a 2-28% risk for urinary tract cancer, a 4-13% risk for bladder cancer and a 3-8% risk for brain cancer.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. Recruits DNA helicase MCM9 to chromatin which unwinds the mismatch containing DNA strand (PubMed:26300262). ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis"})

The antagonistic effect of the secreted glycosylated protein encoded by this gene is likely due to its direct binding to BMP proteins. As an antagonist of BMP, this gene may play a role in regulating organogenesis, body patterning, and tissue differentiation. In mouse, this protein has been shown to relay the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signal from the polarizing region to the apical ectodermal ridge during limb bud outgrowth.

CNC is characterized by myxomas, endocrine tumors and schwannomas. Pigmentary skin lesions are a defining feature, present in over 80% of cases. Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), which can lead to Cushing's syndrome, develops in 25-60% of affected individuals. CNC is associated with an increased risk of developing thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer, myxomas in the heart, breast, skin, throat and female genital tract in addition to psammomatous melanotic schwannomas (PMS) and ovarian tumors. Large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors (LCCSCTs) are observed in nearly all affected males (PMID: 26130139, 16756677).

Autosomal dominant acrodysostosis is characterized by variable skeletal, endocrine, and neurological abnormalities that are present in childhood (PMID: 22464252). The most common features include brachydactyly, dysmorphic facies, short stature, and intellectual disability and/or developmental delays (PMID: 26763073). Other symptoms may include advanced bone age, peripheral dysostosis with shortened bones of the hands and feet, cone-shaped epiphyses, lumbar stenosis, hypothyroidism, multiple hormone resistance, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, deafness and rhinitis (PMID: 22464252, 23033274, 26763073).

Loss of function variants are associated with CNC (PMID: 19293268, 11115848). Some further genotype-phenotype correlations have been suggested for acrodysostosis versus CNC (PMID: 10974026, 10973256, 22464250, 22464252), but these correlations remain preliminary.", fullName: "Protein Kinase CAMP-Dependent Type I Regulatory Subunit Alpha", mechanism: "cAMP is a signaling molecule important for a variety of cellular functions. cAMP exerts its effects by activating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which transduces the signal through phosphorylation of different target proteins. The inactive kinase holoenzyme is a tetramer composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. cAMP causes the dissociation of the inactive holoenzyme into a dimer of regulatory subunits bound to four cAMP and two free monomeric catalytic subunits. Four different regulatory subunits and three catalytic subunits have been identified in humans. This gene encodes one of the regulatory subunits. This protein was found to be a tissue-specific extinguisher that down-regulates the expression of seven liver genes in hepatoma x fibroblast hybrids. Mutations in this gene cause Carney complex (CNC). This gene can fuse to the RET protooncogene by gene rearrangement and form the thyroid tumor-specific chimeric oncogene known as PTC2. A nonconventional nuclear localization sequence (NLS) has been found for this protein which suggests a role in DNA replication via the protein serving as a nuclear transport protein for the second subunit of the Replication Factor C (RFC40). Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been observed. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2013]"})
