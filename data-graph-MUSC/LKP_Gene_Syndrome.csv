Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH) is a condition that primarily affects the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are glands on top of the kidneys that produce hormones regulating many essential functions in the body. PBMAH is a condition that can cause lumps (nodules) to form in the adrenal glands leading them to enlarge and produce too much of a certain hormone (cortisol). Increased cortisol can result in weight gain, high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes, fatigue and bone loss. When symptoms of PBMAH are present, they usually begin in middle age. However, some with PBMAH may not have any obvious symptoms (incomplete penetrance). Specific laboratory tests and imaging are typically used to diagnose PBMAH. A dexamethasone suppression test measures the response of the adrenal glands to the hormone ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone); affected individuals often have elevated cortisol levels in blood and urine as well as low levels of ACTH in blood following this test. Imaging often shows large, nodular adrenal glands. Treatment for severe cases may include the surgical removal of one or both adrenal glands.
