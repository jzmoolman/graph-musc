Pathogenic gain-of-function (GOF) KIT variants are associated with familial GIST and familial mastocytosis.

Familial mastocytosis causes abnormal accumulation of mast cells in the skin and bone marrow (PMID: 27777718, 28031180). In childhood, this condition is known as cutaneous mastocytosis because it manifests in the skin, often resolving by puberty. Adult-onset cases are known as systemic mastocytosis due to involvement of the bone marrow and skin, with potential risks for hematologic malignancy (PMID: 27777718, 28031180).

Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in SMARCA4 are associated with RTPS2, a childhood-onset condition associated with rhabdoid tumors that typically develop in the kidneys and central nervous system. SCCOHT, which is considered part of the RTPS2 clinical spectrum, is a specific type of ovarian cancer associated with hypercalcemia, early age of onset (average 25 years), and small, hyperchromatic cells with brisk mitotic activity. The lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is not well-established.
