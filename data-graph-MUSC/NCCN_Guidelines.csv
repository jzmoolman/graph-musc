Individuals who undergo hysterectomy at the time of RRSO are candidates for estrogen-alone hormone replacement therapy, which is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer compared to combined estrogen and progesterone, which is required when the uterus is left in situ (Chlebowski R, et al. JAMA Oncol 2015;1:296-305). HRT recommendations should be tailored depending on each patient's personal history of breast cancer and/or breast cancer risk reduction strategies. HRT is a consideration for premenopausal patients who do not carry a diagnosis of breast cancer or have other contraindications for HRT. 
Address psychosocial and quality-of-life aspects of undergoing RRSO. Consider preoperative menopause management consultation if patient is still premenopausal at time of RRSO.

Because ovarian cancer onset in patients with BRCA2 P/LP variants is an average of 8-10 years later than in patients with BRCA1 P/LP variants, it is reasonable to delay RRSO for management of ovarian cancer risk until age 40-45 years in patients with BRCA2 P/LP variants unless age at diagnosis in the family warrants earlier age for consideration of prophylactic surgery. 
Counseling includes a discussion of reproductive desires, extent of cancer risk, degree of protection for breast and ovarian cancer, management of menopausal symptoms, hormone replacement therapy, and related medical issues. Salpingectomy alone is not the standard of care for risk reduction, although clinical trials of interval salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy are ongoing. The concern for risk-reducing salpingectomy alone is that women are still at risk for developing ovarian cancer. In addition, in premenopausal women, oophorectomy likely reduces the risk of developing breast cancer but the magnitude is uncertain and may be gene-specific.

Because endometrial cancer can often be detected early based on symptoms, women should be educated regarding the importance of prompt reporting and evaluation of any abnormal uterine bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding. The evaluation of these symptoms should include endometrial biopsy. 
Endometrial cancer screening does not have proven benefit in women with CS/PHTS. However, endometrial biopsy is both highly sensitive and highly specific as a diagnostic procedure. Screening via endometrial biopsy every 1 to 2 years can be considered. 
Transvaginal ultrasound to screen for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal individuals has not been shown to be sufficiently sensitive or specific as to support a positive recommendation, but may be considered at the clinician's discretion.

Codon M918T mutations are considered highest risk and codon 634 and A8883F mutations are considered high risk, with MTC usually presenting at a younger age, whereas other RET mutations associated with MEN2A or FMTC are generally moderate risk. Prophylactic thyroidectomy may be delayed in patients with less high-risk RET mutations that have later onset of MTC, provided the annual basal calcitonin measurement is normal, the annual ultrasound is unremarkable, there is no history of aggressive MTC in the family, and the family is in agreement.

For individuals with MEN2B, total thyroidectomy during the first year of life or at diagnosis. Therapeutic neck dissection as indicated; consider prophylactic bilateral central neck dissection (level VI). Consider more extensive node dissection (levels II-V) if tumor(s) >0.5 cm in diameter. Postoperative administration of levothyroxine to normalize TSH. 
For individuals with MEN2A/FMTC, total thyroidectomy by age 5 or when mutation identified. Therapeutic ipsilateral or bilateral central neck dissection (level Vi) if elevated calcitonin or CEA test or ultrasound identified thyroid or nodal abnormality. Propphylactic neck dissection may not be required if serum calcitonin is less than 40 ng/mL, because lymph node metastases are unlikely with minor calcitonin elevations in this setting. Consider prophylactic ipsilateral modified neck dissection if there is high-volume or gross isease in the adjacent central neck.

538,TP53,,General,0,Testing Considerations,"Somatic TP53 variants frequently confound germline testing results. Late post-zygotic aberrant clonal expansions containing a pathogenic TP53 variant, limited to hematologic compartment or to a tumor, may be detected in the blood or saliva through germline testing, particularly using NGS technology. The phenomenon of aberrant clonal expansion is well described and is most often due to CHIP, which can be demonstrated in healthy populations at increasing frequency with increasing age. This finding has important clinical implications regarding potential application of unwarranted clinical interventions. Further, the finding of clonal hematopoiesis itself may portend adverse clinical outcomes, such as the development of hematologic neoplasia and increased non-hematologic mortality. 
Blood and/or saliva is an unsuitable source of DNA for germline testing for cases with a history of hematologic abnormalities. Careful examination of the patient's complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral blood smear may be warranted in all cases reporting the discovery of a TP53 P/LP variant, and testing of non-lymphoid ancillary tissues may help to delineate bona fide mosaic involvement of different germ layers.
