Mutations carriers have an increased risk of prostate cancer before age 65 years, and prostate cancer in men with germline BRCA2 or HOXB13 mutations occurs earlier and is more likely to be associated with prostate cancer mortality. For men with BRCA1, ATM, or mismatch repair (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) germline gene mutations timing of testing is less clear. Consequently, prostate cancer screening is recommended at age 40 years for BRCA2 carriers, and it is reasonable for men with other germline mutations to consider beginning shared decision-making about PSA screening at age 40 years and to consider screening at annual intervals rather than every other year. In addition, the panel believes that men with a family history of prostate cancer (defined as brother or father or multiple family members who were diagnosed with prostate cancer [but not clinically localized Grade Group 1] at <60 years of age or who died from prostate cancer) should begin shared decision-making about PSA screening at the age corresponding to 10 years prior to the age of the youngest family diagnosis. Men of African American ancestry have a higher incidence of prostate cancer, increased prostate cancer mortality, and earlier age of diagnosis compared to Caucasian men. This is attributable to a greater risk of developing preclinical prostate cancer and a higher likelihood that a preclinical tumor will spread. Many support the recommendation for men of African ancestry to consider beginning shared decision-making about PSA screening at age 40 years and to consider screening at annual intervals rather than every other year. There is no current evidence to support that screening at an earlier age will result in decreased morbidity and mortality compared to testing at age 45.Testing after 75 years of age should be done only in very healthy men with little or no comorbidity (especially if they have never undergone PSA testing or have a rising PSA) to detect the small number of aggressive cancers that pose a significant risk if left undetected until signs or symptoms develop.

However, one notable exception is the multi-focality of pancreaticoduodenal NETs in patients with MEN1. The role of surgery remains controversial in patients with multifocal tumors. Decision to resect a pancreatic or duodenal NET in the setting of multifocal disease is complex. If surgery is performed to resect hormonally functional tumor(s), attempts should be made to preoperatively localize the site of the functional tumor. Surgical resection can be considered in the following scenarios: symptomatic functional tumors refractory to medical management, tumor larger than 2 cm in size, Tumor with relatively rapid rate of growth over 6-12 months. Endoscopy with EUS is recommended prior to pancreatic surgery in order to preoperatively assess the localized tumors.
